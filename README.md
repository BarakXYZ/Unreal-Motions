# Unreal-Motions üñêÔ∏è‚ú®
Unreal Engine ergonomic tools that will keep your hands (and soul!) healthy[er] üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Features 

### Windows Navigation ü™ü
Navigate between editor windows effortlessly using keyboard shortcuts!<br>
- Use `Ctrl + Period` to cycle to the next none-root window and `Ctrl + Comma` to cycle to the previous none-root window
- Toggle between root window and other windows using `Ctrl + Forward Slash` - minimizes non-root windows to focus root window, or vice versa
- You can expect solid focus activation when navigating between windows (unlike UE's occasional issue where focus remains on the previous window after navigation)
- Customize any hotkey configuration in preferences - simply search for "Cycle Window" to find all available commands

### Major & Minor Tab Navigation üîÑ
Navigate between editor tabs using customizable keyboard shortcuts just like you navigate browser tabs!<br>
The plugin is designed to work alongside existing Unreal Engine shortcuts:
- By default, the plugin uses `Ctrl + Shift + 0-9` for Major Tabs && `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + 0-9` for Minor Tabs to avoid conflicts with Unreal's built-in Viewport & BP Graph Editor Bookmark shortcuts (`Ctrl + 0-9`).
- The plugin won't override any existing shortcuts by default, but I definitely recommend using the Editor Utility Widget I provide to change Major Tab navigation to use `Ctrl + 0-9` && Minor Tab navigation to use `Ctrl + Shift + 0-9` and accordingly to move Viewport & Graph Bookmarks to `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + 0-9`.
- Another way to navigate between tabs is using `Ctrl + ]` for moving to the next tab, and `Ctrl + [` for moving to the previous tab. Similarly, you can navigate back and forth in Minor Tabs using `Ctrl + Shift + ]` & `Ctrl + Shift + [`.<br>
You can of course adjust these hotkeys to your liking in Preferences (for example override the default next tab shortcut `Ctrl + Tab` & back `Ctrl + Shift + Tab`!).
- The Tab shortcuts can be found in Edit -> Editor Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts:<br>
Type in the search bar "Focus Tab" and you should see the custom tab commands you can customize.

Since some users (muah) might prefer to move their bookmarks to `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + 0-9`, I've included a Editor Utility Widget that lets you:
- Easily clear and Auto-Setup Hotkeys to the recommened or any configuration you like quickly and easily!
- Have a quick overview of the currently set configuration and hotkeys.
- Try out different modifiers to find your perfect configuration and iterate quickly!

## Support & Installation üîß
1. The plugin should work safely in UE 5.3 to 5.5. I believe 5.0+ should also work (but haven't tested that). Keep in mind that the Editor Utility Widget won't show up in versions earlier than 5.3. If really needed you can manually copy paste the logic and recreate it.
1. Create a `Plugins` folder in your Unreal Engine project's root directory (if it doesn't exist)
2. Clone this repository into the `Plugins` folder:
```bash
# From your project's root directory
cd Plugins
git clone https://github.com/BarakXYZ/Unreal-Motions.git
```
3. Restart the Unreal Editor
4. The plugin should now be available in your project!

## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è
This plugin is inspired by Vim Motions and the core principle of keeping your hands on the keyboard. As someone who understands the impact of repetitive mouse movements on wrist health, I'm committed to expanding this plugin with more ergonomic tools that enhance Unreal Editor navigation. Each new feature will focus on reducing mouse dependency and improving workflow efficiency. Stay tuned for more keyboard-centric improvements! üöÄ
